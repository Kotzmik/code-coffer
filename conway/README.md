## Conway's Game of Life

**[Live preview](https://accnotfound.ovh/conway.html)**

Made using **React** and **Vite**.

# Main features:

    - start and pause the simulation
    - change the state of a cell by manually clicking on the grid
    - automatically populate the board with given percentage,
    - clear button
    - changeable speed of the cycles (works during the simulation) [input in ms]
    - dynamic size of the cell grid
    - cycle counter.

Due to my lack of interest in learning enterprise networks, this project has been abandoned. Maybe it will be remade in a more developer-friendly framework.
